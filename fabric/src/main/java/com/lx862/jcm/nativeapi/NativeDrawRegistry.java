/**
 * NativeDrawRegistry — where the per-car draw calls of a NATIVE script wait
 * between being captured and being replayed.
 *
 * <p>The JS pipeline has the same two-stage split: {@code RenderVehiclesMixin}
 * fills a {@code VehicleScriptInstance.capturedScriptCalls}, and
 * {@code VehicleResourceMixin} replays it while MTR draws that car. Native
 * scripts bypass the whole Rhino instance machinery, so they need their own
 * (much smaller) holder — this class.
 *
 * <p>Keyed by {@code vehicleHexId + '\u0000' + scriptId} so a vehicle that
 * uses several resources/scripts cannot mix their cars up.
 *
 * <p>Thread affinity: both the capture (RenderVehicles.render) and the replay
 * (VehicleResource.queue) happen on the render thread, but assets reload can
 * clear from another thread — hence the synchronized map and the defensive
 * copy in {@link #get}.
