/**
 * crash_guard.hpp — turn a hard crash inside a native script into a logged,
 * recoverable failure.
 *
 * Why: the field crash we are chasing surfaced as an ACCESS_VIOLATION inside
 * VCRUNTIME140.dll's memcpy with the calling frame already unwound, which made
 * it impossible to attribute from the hs_err log alone — and it took the whole
 * game down. A script module is optional content: if one throws a structured
 * exception, the right behaviour is to disable THAT module, log where it
 * happened, and keep the game running with the other modules intact.
 *
 * Windows: __try/__except around the entry point (SEH catches access
 * violations; C++ try/catch does not).
 * Other toolchains: a plain C++ try/catch, which at least handles C++
 * exceptions escaping the module (std::bad_alloc from a giant texture, etc).
 * POSIX signals are deliberately not trapped — longjmp-ing out of a SIGSEGV
 * is not something this SDK should attempt.
